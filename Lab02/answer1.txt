•	Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?


•	Answer:
  - No, it is not possible to create a constructor method by “title” and then another constructor method by “category”.
  - This is because "title" and "category" are both of type String, so if 2 constructors are created, they will hae the same signature.
  - This violates method overloading rules, we can only create multiple constructors as long as they have different signature, in this case, is the parameters list.
